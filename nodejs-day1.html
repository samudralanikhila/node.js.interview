    <h1>What is node.js ?</h1>
    <ul type="none">
      <li>
        ➔ Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for
        executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.
      </li>
      <li>
        ➔ You need to remember that NodeJS is not a framework and it’s not a
        programming language. Most of the people are confused and understand
        it’s a framework or a programming language.
      </li>
      <li>
        ➔ We often use Node.js for building back-end services like APIs like Web
        App or Mobile App. It’s used in production by large companies such as
        Paypal, Uber, Netflix, Walmart and so on.
      </li>
      <li>
        ➔ Node.js is a platform for building the i/o applications which are
        server-side event-driven and made using JavaScript. It is used to build
        server-side, input-output, event-driven apps. It is built on Google’s V8
        engine
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What is NPM?</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        NPM stands for the node package manager, npm is used for node dependency
        management.
      </li>
      <li>
        Most of the time, we use npm as a server-side node dependency tool
      </li>
      <li>
        NPM gets installed with NodeJs installation. NPM uses nested
        dependencies, so we can use different versions of any module in our
        code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Nested dependencies mean that any dependency is again dependent on
        another dependency npm: It is a package manager for the JavaScript
        programming language.
      </li>
      <li>
        It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment
        Node.js. Help to manage a project’s dependencies. npm is installed with
        Node automatically.
      </li>
      <li>
        npm: NPM generates a ‘package-lock.json’ file. the package-lock will
        generate the same node_modules folder for different npm versions
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>What are the modules in Node.js?</h1>
    <p>
      In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicates
      with an external application on the basis of their related functionality.
      Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders.
    </p>
    <b>Modules are of three types:</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Core Modules</li>
      <li>local Modules</li>
      <li>Third-party Modules</li>
    </ul>
